# snakegame

A basic retro game inspired by [engineer-man](https://github.com/engineer-man) series in youtube. Go check the original code [here](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/015).

In the samples folder are simple examples that helped me undertanding the curses library.
- the samlple.py - undertanding the main keys of the library, see more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).
- the colors.py - undertanding who to import the only 8 colors that command line support, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17122268/python-how-to-create-static-text-in-curses/17122544#17122544?newreg=cfa743aafc6345d582b36725edb6d160).
